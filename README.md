# Focal-Dice Loss ResNet Task

## Attribution
- The implementation of `focal_loss` and `dice_loss` used in this project are from [ShannonAI/dice_loss_for_NLP](https://github.com/ShannonAI/dice_loss_for_NLP).
- The ResNet UNet implementation (`resnet_unet.py`) is adapted from [YusufAtti/TuSimple-Lane-Detection-with-ResNet-UNet-Focal-Loss](https://github.com/YusufAtti/TuSimple-Lane-Detection-with-ResNet-UNet-Focal-Loss/blob/main/resnet_unet.py).

## Project Overview
This project implements a ResNet model using Dice Loss + focal loss for the image detection task.
